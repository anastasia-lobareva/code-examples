# code-examples repository

This repository contains examples of coding in C and Java. I will be adding more examples as I progress with my learning.

## c

The c folder contains examples of coding in C. Each example is contained in its own file and is well-commented for better understanding.

## java

The java folder contains examples of apps written in Java. Similar to the C examples, each Java example is in its own file with detailed comments.

## How to Use

You can browse the examples in each folder to see the code. If you want to run the examples, ensure you have the necessary compilers and development environment set up for C and Java.
